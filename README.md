# ARIMA-TimeSeriesPredictive-Modeling
This project uses an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict future numbers in a sequence based on a historical dataset. The model is trained on a dataset of six sequences of numbers, and it predicts the next three numbers in each sequence.
